Bomb (Boomjs builder)
=====================

A builder for web frond-end, optimize specially for boomjs.


Install Requirement
--------------------

*   Java Runtime Environment(JRE). Bomb use google closure compiler and YUI
	compresser to compile js and css respectively, And they are java applications.
	So JRE is requirement.

*   Any SVN client command-line tools such as
	[collab's binary package](http://www.collab.net/downloads/subversion).
	TortoriseSVN maybe not include command-line tools so it not appropriate in
	this situation.

*   Except install the two software that we mentioned above(SVN and JRE),
	you need add they path to `PATH` variable. For more information about
	JRE path you can refer
	<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html>
	SVN is similar to JRE.

*   Python iterpreter of course, this is python script.

TIPS: I advise you add python script path to your `PATH` variable if you use
windows, this can supply convenience to execute python script like bomb.
